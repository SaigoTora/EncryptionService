# Instructions for use

When you first launch the application, you will be greeted with a welcome screen and options to select the desired cryptography topic.

Available topics include:

- Symmetric encryption: using transposition ciphers  
- Symmetric encryption: using substitution ciphers  
- Symmetric encryption: use of stream ciphers (additive ciphers) and pseudorandom sequence generators  
- Asymmetric encryption  
- Hashing  
- Cryptanalysis  

Expanding each topic allows you to choose a specific algorithm or method to work with. After selecting the desired algorithm, you will be directed to a page containing input fields, action buttons, and results of the encryption or decryption operations.

Most encryption keys and related parameters are stored in the `appsettings.json` file, allowing you to modify them at any time according to your needs.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive educational tool for exploring various cryptographic methods.  
Use it responsibly and enjoy learning the fundamentals of encryption and security.
